# Preface
Virtualization has become mainstream.  Anyone wanting to virtualize their operating system can do so on their laptop or desktop. I approached it the same way because I needed to virtualize a Linux server on my work desktop. I embarked on VirtualBox as it's free. VirtualBox helped me get my server going that same afternoon. As I delved into the world of virtualization, I realized that there isn't much to learn to get started.  However, as I started exploring I realized there is much to know to realize the full power of virtualization.

I run my own server at home on physical machines and I recognized that I needed to move them to virtualized servers.  It will ease some of my pain points with upgrades, testing and segregation of the architecture. I can now architect my server much like the ones I build for my clients, without having to buy a dozen servers.
Besides cost, I value space, power consumption, time and effort to maintain my server. These considerations are manageable with VMs.

When I embarked on the task of redesigning my home server infrastructure, I dug deeper into the technology. And as I researched, I learned interesting things both about virtualization and VirtualBox. I wanted to be confident that the technology and tools would help me achieve my goals. The server at my home is a production server as it servers several email gateways, websites and applications. If I am considering to virtualize my production server with a 7Ã—24 up-time requirement, I wanted to be sure.

As I was reading and experimenting more with virtualization with emphasis on VirtualBox, I was excited every step of the way. During this process, I felt compelled to write this book. There was not a comprehensive and practical book of the technology and tools available. There was a lot of scattered information on the internet, but nothing concise and organized to educates someone to become a competent virtualization administrator. The discussions (online) were limited to use of simple GUI functions of VirtualBox and limited use of the more advanced features. Also, VirtualBox has evolved over the years, as has the rest of virtualization technology. This has left much of the online discussions outdated or sometimes inaccurate. I also found a lot of misconceptions about virtualizations and VirtualBox which I will help to uncover in this book.

My own adoption has been slow as I had to spend countless days experimenting between what works and what does not.  The standardization and solution that I am presenting in the book has been already achieved in the commercial space. But I am not looking to buy expensive software for my servers. I needed something simple, working, maintainable, automatable and free. With these considerations I wrote a manual that I can follow and be successful. That manual is now this book, born out of my own desire to document my knowledge of VirtualBox.



### What is covered?
The book covers use of VirtualBox under the Debian-based host and guest operating systems. The scripts and examples are based on and tested with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) running both on the host as well as the guest. Scripts are transferable to other Linux host and guest operating system, however they may require some changes.  For Windows and Mac operating systems, read the scripts to guide you through the steps to follow.

This book enables you to manage VirtualBox server using command-line. You can maintain your server remotely without using GUI, although it does not prevent the use of GUI. The guest operating system can be GUI (if that is what you require to virtualize) as VirtualBox provides a remote desktop feature for GUI guests.

The GUI is not described here as it is straight forward to understand and the GUI offers a subset of VirtualBox features. The power to using and maintaining virtualization is in the command-line. For more control and automation, you may have to use VirtualBox SDK/API programming. The book does not enter into the VirtualBox SDK realm and is limited to command line.


### How is this book written?
A lot of thought went into simplifying the explanations to what is the ideal amount of detail that a technology enthusiasts would appreciate and digest. The ideas and procedures presented have been tested and are implementation ready. The goal was to include everything that would be important to create, maintain and use in VirtualBox.  The book does expect you to have some systems administration background to appreciate the concise writing. The approach also turns the book into an effective reference guide.

The script listings are available for download at [[http://virtualbox.snathan.org|http://virtualbox.snathan.org]]. Reading through the scripts will help you understand the steps involved in the task.  Or you can take the approach of using the scripts to complete the task, without regard to the individual steps/commands. Ideally you would want to examine and customize the scripts to your specific environment.

This book will save you 100's of hours researching, understanding, experimenting and deciding on a right approach on virtualization. It will help you become an expert, and also let you have a stable foundation should you decide to expand your career in virtualization.
